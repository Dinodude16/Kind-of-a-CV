        <p>
        <h4>I have attended 4 locations of schooling in my educative years. A preschool, primary school, and two
            secondary schools.</h4>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>First off, I went to Playcentre New Plymouth for two years I think, from the ages of 3 to 5.</li>
            <li>Seccondly, I attended Vogeltown primary school for six years, of which I remember little of what I did,
                and
                only retained three proper friends, but altogether, it was fun.</li>
            <li>After year six, came year 7. I chose to go to <a href="https://www.fdmc.school.nz/">Francis Douglas
                    Memorial
                    College,</a> and for two miserable years, I made two friends, kept neither of them, and hated the
                school
                in general.</li>
            <li>Currently I consume my education through the means of <a href="https://www.spotswoodcollege.school.nz/">
                    Spotswood College,</a>where I have made many friends, and
                am getting ready for the outside world. I have been here since year nine, and I am currently at the
                start of
                year 12.</li>
        </ul>
