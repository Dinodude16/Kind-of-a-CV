        Hi! My name is Luke Quest Davey, and I am learning to code. Presently, I am working at <a
            href="https://www.learnerme.ac.nz/">LearnerMe,</a> Innovation
        Headquarters, and I am finding that code is a lot less daunting than it may seem at first, and actually seems
        pretty
        fun!

    <h2 class="georgia-font">Education</h2>

    <p>
    <h4>I have attended 4 locations of schooling in my educative years. A preschool, primary school, and two secondary
        schools.</h4>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>First off, I went to Playcentre New Plymouth for two years I think, from the ages of 3 to 5.</li>
        <li>Seccondly, I attended Vogeltown primary school for six years, of which I remember little of what I did, and
            only retained three proper friends, but altogether, it was fun.</li>
        <li>After year six, came year 7. I chose to go to <a href="https://www.fdmc.school.nz/">Francis Douglas Memorial
                College,</a> and for two miserable years, I made two friends, kept neither of them, and hated the school
            in general.</li>
        <li>Currently I consume my education through the means of <a href="https://www.spotswoodcollege.school.nz/">
                Spotswood College,</a>where I have made many friends, and
            am getting ready for the outside world. I have been here since year nine, and I am currently at the start of
            year 12.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="georgia-font">My Hobbies</h2>

    <p>
    <h4>I dont have many hobbies, but most are hand on, and often have something to do with tinkering with things</h4>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>I love playing video games of many sorts, especially creative ones like <a
                href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a></li>
        <li>Tinkering with and taking things apart is something that I like to do. For a small example; I often
            take apart pens that I
            have, to see what interesting mechanisms are inside.</li>
        <li>And lastly, I really like technology. Specifically computers, speakers and manufacturing as broad terms.</li>
        <li>I am also talented in 3D modeling using <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad,</a> and 3D
            printing because ave recenly gotten an <a href="https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-3d-printer">Ender 3 FDM 3D printer</a></li>
