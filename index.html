        <p>This is a quick and dirty website to showcase the development of my custom variable density orthotic insoles.
            It will act as a dump, and a blog of sorts to document my progress on the project. Best Viewed on computer

        <h3>I found a model on Thingiverse called "Variable Density Insole" by Gyrobot at

            </a>

            This piqued my interest as an interesting concept for an affordable, customisable way for me to create
            my own orthotic insoles.

            The zones highlighted in different colours are not based on any actual research, more simply how I would
            expect different areas would need different amounts of support

        <h3>The purple shape above is my prototyping of the arch support, with rough measurements using calipers. As you
            can
            see this worked, but not super well and may have worked better if I had another way to creating a form</h3>

        <h2>Questions for blaire</h2>
            <li><h3>What tools do you use. Any free ones?</li>
            <li><h3>How sensitive are different areas of the foot/ankle to different amounts of force?</li>
            <li><h3>How do you get a mold/model of the patients foot?</li>
            <li><h3>What kind of materials do you work with/are possible?</li>
            <li><h3>How important is the softness of the insole?</li>
            <li><h3>Considered a hard insole? Like full plastic? Possibly if you got the support and fit perfectly, would it befeasible?</li>
            <li><h3>How important is a sock when contacting the insole?</li>
            <li><h3>Why are the bottoms not flat on the insole? Surely a rounded bottom would be susceptible to movement and malplacement?</li>
            <li><h3>If there was a toe shield type thing, that sat in the end of a shoe to make up the difference of show sizes, do you think that would affect the walking/ effect of the insole?</li>
            <li><h3>My project can be adapted for shoe insoles or jandals/sandals</h3></li>
